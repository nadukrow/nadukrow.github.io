After completing the HTML subject matter I was able to start with the CSS lesson plans. Going through the material and learning CSS syntax was great in helping me gain a better understanding of how CSS and HTML are interconnected. I would describe my particular style of working with CSS as a very curious adapter. I actually like to browse other sites and get inspired by their sites layout. I also try to pay attention to their background use and the colors they use against their font selection. Column structure, scrolling fluidity, and site responsiveness is also something I take note of as well.
	
Once I feel sufficiently inspired to try a new look or feel for a website I’l start to sketch a mockup of the index/about page. I use that as my base point before adding more pages to the site. As I build more pages I always make sure that the I don’t just make it consistent, but that the consistency matches the content of the page. While a set up may work for a particular page, it’s important to work with your content. Some pages may require two columns and others may require four.
	
I think overall I try to look at good examples for similar types of site content and borrow what I can. For me it’s important to really get a good understanding of the high level before I start diving into creating the structure for each site and the styling for it as well.
