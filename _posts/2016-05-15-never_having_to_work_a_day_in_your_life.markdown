On a consistent basis I've been told I'm great with people. Not so great with math or logic. Comments like that create the kind of doubt that prevents risks. Using others comments, I've been able to navigate life and find things that would fit me. This led me to seek opportunities in various industries and fields so that I could find my passion.

I went to college with a focus on pre med. After classes everyday I would read tech blogs centered on applications for smartphones (this was during the "Rise of the Apps" trend AKA July 2008 onward).

When I interned at a disabilities foundation, and I was tasked with raising funds to go towards specific programs, I would spend a good portion of my time looking at how terribly made their website was and looking at other web designs that nonprofits have used.

When I was hired by Booz Allen Hamilton as a Consultant I thought I could combine what others thought of my strengths as well as my own interest in technology. However as time went on, I began to feel more and more unfulfilled.

What it really boils down to is passion. For too long I've allowed other opinions and self doubt to dictate what I should and shouldn't pursue in life. My interest has always been in software development and yet I couldn't admit it to my parents, friends, and most importantly myself. 

Why I chose to learn software development was because of the power of simple lines of code. With code, the applications are endless. It's benefits towards medicine excites me. The potential uses cases that VR can have on education is compelling. The fact that practical ideas can disrupt age old industries (Uber and the taxi industry) is amazing. Forgive me I'm getting ahead of myself!

All in all, I'm well aware that it takes real hard work and experience to be considered competent with code. And it doesn't stop there. Not only do I need to keep up with new ways of thinking at a rapid pace, but I'll need to think along the lines of concept rather than being a code monkey. 

My passion is code and how it can benefit others. Whether it is a small company fixing the UI of their website, or working on the next compelling algorithm for a major data driven company, software development is where my passion and interests align.

I'll never have to feel like I'm working a day in my life this way.
